# Marketing Analytics Project - on reaching out to the Most Probable Buyers
* Given the limited marketing budget, marketers can only reach out to a portion of the total target audience
* But, what if **they can segregate their entire target audience on the basis of their probability of buying?**
* In that case, they may target the most probable buyers only and save the money they would have otherwise wasted on the ones with low probability of buying
* This is precisely how analytics-enablement can help any marketing function to maximise business revenue and optimize their marketing funnel by smartly allocating their funds, at scale
