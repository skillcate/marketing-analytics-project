Reaching out to the Most Probable Buyers with your Marketing Campaign, with Machine Learning. Given the limited marketing budget, marketers can only reach out to a portion of the total target audience.  But, what if they can segregate their entire target audience on the basis of their probability of buying. In that case, they may target the most probable buyers only and save the money they would have otherwise wasted on the ones with low probability of buying.  This is precisely how analytics-enablement can help any marketing function to maximise business revenue and optimize their marketing funnel by smartly allocating their funds, at scale.
